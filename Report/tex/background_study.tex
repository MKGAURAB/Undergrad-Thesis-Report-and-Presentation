\section{Literature Review}
After defining the problem specifically, the first thing is to have a good literature review to ensure that we are not going to waste our time by rediscovering anything. In this case, there are more than 95 mapper tools are developed till now according to on of the benchmarking\cite{mapperBenchmark}. But most of them are aligner. As it is stated before, aligner and mapper are separated in recent years. Before that these two words are used alternatively. On the other hand, all of them are not general purpose tools, rather their dedication goes to some categories like DNA, RNA, bi-sulfite, miRNA etc.\cite{mapperBenchmark}. Here, some tools are presented which are best matches with our task. Later in this chapter, some basics are covered to understand the work properly.
