\chapter{Methodology}
In this chapter we would discuss our approaches conceptually to reach a solution. Different approaches works better in different conditions. Some could map very efficiently but they takes time. Some may map rough but give result fast. Some work better when data is error free. Our target is ONT reads which has errors. So, at last we merged all the techniques that necessary to conclude a tool which could survive against so many errors in reads.
